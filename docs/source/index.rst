Python for network engineers
============================

Book covers Python basics with examples and tasks based on networking topics.

From the one hand, book is basic enough so everyone can handle it, from the other hand, book considers all main topics which allow you to develop skill independently in the future. Python deep dive is not a goal of this book. The goal is to explain Python basics in plain language and provide understanding of necessary tools for practical usage. Everything in this book is focused on network equipment and interaction with it. It right away gives opportunity to use knowledge gained at the course in network engineers daily work. All shown examples are based on Cisco equipment but, of course, they could be applied to any other equipment.

    Python 3.7 is used in this book.
