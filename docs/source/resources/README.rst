Continuing education
====================

Information is usually hard to grasp from the first time. Especially new information.

If you do your homework and make notes during your study, you learn a lot more information than if you just read a book. But most likely, in some way you’ll have to read about the same information several times.

Book provides only basics of Python and therefore it is necessary to continue to learn and to repeat already completed topics and to learn new ones. And there are a lot of options:

-  automate something at work
-  learn more Python for network automation
-  learn Python without binding to network equipment

    These resources are listed selectively, considering you’ve already read the book. But in addition, I’ve made a compilation of resources  <https://natenka.github.io/pyneng-resources/>`__ where other materials can be found.

Scripting for workflow automation
------------------------------------------------------

Most likely, after reading the book there will be ideas what you can automate at work. It’s a great option, because it’s always easier to learn on a real problem. But it is better to go beyond work tasks and study Python further.

Python allows you to do quite a lot with only basic knowledge. Therefore, with work tasks it is not always possible to increase level of knowledge, but knowing Python better you can usually solve the same problems much more easily. So it’s best not to stop and learn.

The following resources are connected to network equipment and generally Python. Depending on from what materials you learn best you can select a book or video course from list

Python for network equipment automation
-------------------------------------------------------

Books:

-  `Network Programmability and Automation: Skills for the
   Next-Generation Network
   Engineer <https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer/dp/1491931256>`__
-  `Mastering Python Networking (Eric
   Chou) <https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-python-networking>`__
   - is partly similar to what was discussed in this book but there are many new themes. Plus, examples are considered not only on Cisco equipment but on Juniper and Arista as well.

Python without binding to network equipment
-------------------------------------------

Books
~~~~~

Basic level:

* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) - good book on Python basics. There are tasks in the book.
* [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9RI/) - a book on Python basics. Half of the book is dedicated to "standard" description of Python basics and in the second half these bases are used for projects. There are tasks in the book.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). [In Russian](https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/137673590/) -  in this book you can find many ideas on automation of daily work. These topics are: working with PDF, Excel, Word, sending letters, working with pictures, working with the web


Medium/advanced level:

* [Python Tricks](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Tricks-Buffet-Awesome-Features-ebook/dp/B0785Q7GSY) - excellent for 2-3 books on Python. Book describes various aspects of Python and how to use it correctly. The book is fairly new (late 2017) and reviews Python 3.

At the end of 2019 [the second edition of book is planned] (https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134853989/).
* [Dive Into Python 3](http://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/) - briefly considered fundamentals of Python and then more advanced topics: closure, generators, tests and so on. Book written in 2009 but considered by Python 3 and 99% of topics remained unchanged.
* [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) - excellent book on data structures and algorithms. Many examples and homework. [In Russian] (http://aliev.me/runestone/)
* [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491946008/) -  excellent book on more advanced topics. Even topics that are obsolete in the current version of Python (asyncio) are worth reading for a perfect explanation of topic.
* [Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449340377/) - great recipe book. A huge number of scenarios are considered with solutions and explanations.
