Almost every book chapter has subchapter "Additional materials" which includes useful materials and references on the subject, plus references to official documentations. Moreover, I prepared a `collection <https://natenka.github.io/pyneng-resources/>`__ of resources on "Python for network engineers" topic where you can find a lot of useful articles, books, video courses and podcasts.
