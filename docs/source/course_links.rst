Useful resources
----------------

Here are the links to all resources which will be helpful during study process:

-  `Virtual machines for this course <https://pyneng.github.io/docs/course-vm/>`__;
-  `Repositories with examples and tasks <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises-en/>`__

Almost every book chapter has subchapter "Further reading" which includes useful materials and references on the subject, plus references to official documentations. Moreover, I prepared a `collection <https://natenka.github.io/pyneng-resources-en/>`__ of resources on "Python for network engineers" topic where you can find a lot of useful articles, books, video courses and podcasts.
