About book
-------

From the one hand, book is basic enough so everyone can handle it,
from the other hand, book covers all
main topics which allow you to develop skill independently in the future.
Python deep dive is not a goal of this book. The goal is to explain Python
basics in plain language and provide understanding of necessary tools for
practical usage. Everything in this book is focused on network equipment and
interaction with it. It right away gives opportunity to use knowledge gained
at the course in network engineers daily work. All shown examples are based
on Cisco equipment but, of course, they could be applied to any other equipment.

Who is this book for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For network engineers with or without programming experience. All examples and
homework will be formed with a focus on network equipment. This book will be
useful for network engineers who want to automate their daily basis routine
tasks and want start coding but don't know how to approach this.
Still haven't decided whether it worth reading this book? Read :ref:`feedbacks <testimonials>`.


OS and Python requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All examples and terminal outputs in the book are shown on Debian Linux.
Python 3.7 is used in this book but for the majority of examples Python 3.x
will be enough. Only some examples requires Python version higher than 3.6.
It always explicitly indicated and generally concerns some additional features.

Examples
~~~~~~~

All examples from the book resides in 
`repository <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises-en>`__.
All examples have educational purpose. It means they not necessarily show the
best solution since they are based on information which was covered in previous
chapters. Moreover, often enough the examples in chapters are developing in
tasks. In other words, in tasks you have to create better, more universal and,
in general, more proper version of code. It's better to write code from the book
on your own or at least download examples and try to modify them. So the
information will be better remembered. If you don't have this possibility,
for example when you read book on road, it's better to repeat examples later
on your own. In any case, it's necessary to do tasks manually.

Tasks
~~~~~~~

All tasks and auxiliary files can be downloaded from the same
`repository  <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises-en>`__,
where code examples are located.


Book formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Book is available in PDF and Epub formats. Both of them are being updated
automatically.
