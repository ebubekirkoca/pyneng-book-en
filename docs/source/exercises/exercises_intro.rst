If you have tasks with letters (for example, 5.2a) in a section, it is better to do tasks without letters and then with letters. Tasks with letter tend to be slightly more complex than letter-free tasks and they develop or complicate the idea in the respective task without letter.

.. note::
    For example, in the section there are tasks 5.1, 5.2, 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.3, 5.3a.
    First it is better to complete 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and then 5.2a, 5.2b,
    5.3a

If you can do a task with letters right away, it is better to do it in order.
