Task 2.1
^^^^^^^^^^^

Create your repository based on `repository template <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises/>`__ with tasks and examples. To do this, press "Use this template".

Created repository will be a copy of pyneng-examples-exercises repository, but is not tied to it. Itâ€™s better to perform tasks in prepared files in *exercises* directory as tests for tasks depend on created directory structure.
