6. Compound statements
============================

So far, all code has been executed sequentially - all lines of script have been executed in order in which they are written in file. This section discusses how Python can manage the program:

* branching with help of ``if/elif/else`` construction
* repetition of actions in loop using ``for`` and ``while`` constructions
* error handling with ``try/except`` construction
