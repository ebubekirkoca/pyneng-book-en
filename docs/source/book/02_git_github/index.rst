2. Using Git and Github
=============================

There are a lot of tasks in the book and you have to store them somewhere. One option is to use Git and Github to do this. Of course, there are other ways to do this but Github can be used for other things in the future.
Tasks and examples from the book are in a separate `repository <https://github.com/natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises/>`__
on Github. They can be downloaded as a zip archive but it is better to work with the repository using Git, then you can see the changes made and easily update the repository. If this is the first time working with Git and especially if this is the first version control system you work with, there are a lot of information, so this chapter focuses on the practical side of the question and it says:

-  How to start using Git and Github;
-  How to perform the basic setup;
-  How to view information and/or changes.

There will be no much theory in this subsection but references to useful resources are given. Try doing all the basic settings for the tasks and then continue reading the book. And at the end, when the basic work with Git and Github is already routine, read more about them. What could Git be useful for:

-  to store configurations and all configuration changes;
-  to store the documentation and all its versions;
-  to store schemes and all its versions;
-  to store the code and its versions.

Github allows you to centrally store all the above items, but it should be taken into account that these resources will be available to others as well. Github also has private repositories (paid), but even these probably should not contain information such as passwords. Of course, the main use of Github is to place the code of various projects. In addition, Github is also:

-  hosting for your website  (`GitHub
   Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__);
-  Hosting for online presentations and a tool to create them
   (`GitPitch <https://gitpitch.com/>`__);
-  together with `GitBook <https://www.gitbook.com>`__, it is also a platform for publishing books, documentation, etc.
