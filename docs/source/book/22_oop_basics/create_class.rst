Class creation
---------------

.. note::

    Note that the basis is explained here given that the reader has no experience with OOP. Some examples are not very correct from Pythonâ€™s ideology point of view, but they help to better understand how it works. At the end, an explanation is given of how this should be done in proper way.

Keyword ``class`` is used in python to create classes. The easiest class you can create in Python:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: class Switch:
       ...:     pass
       ...:

.. note::

    Class names: usually class names in Python are written in CamelCase format.

To create a class instance, call class:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: sw1 = Switch()

    In [3]: print(sw1)
    <__main__.Switch object at 0xb44963ac>

Using dot notation, it is possible to derive values of instance variables, create new variables and assign a new value to existing ones:

.. code:: python

    In [5]: sw1.hostname = 'sw1'

    In [6]: sw1.model = 'Cisco 3850'

In another instance of Switch class, the variables may be different:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: sw2 = Switch()

    In [8]: sw2.hostname = 'sw2'

    In [9]: sw2.model = 'Cisco 3750'

You can see value of instance variables using the same dot notation:

.. code:: python

    In [10]: sw1.model
    Out[10]: 'Cisco 3850'

    In [11]: sw2.model
    Out[11]: 'Cisco 3750'
