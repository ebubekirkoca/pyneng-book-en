Namespace. Scope of variables
------------------------------------

Variables in Python have a scope. Depending on the location in the code where variable has been defined, the scope is also defined, it determines where variable will be available.

When using variable names in a program, Python searches, creates or changes these names in the corresponding namespace each time. The namespace that is available at each moment depends on the area in which the code is located.

Python has a LEGB rule that it uses for variables search.

For example, when accessing a variable within a function, Python searches for a variable in this order in scopes (before the first match):

* L (local) - in local (within function)
* E (enclosing) - in the local area of outer functions (these are the functions within which our function is located)
* G (global) - in global (in script)
* B (built-in) - in built-in (reserved Python values)

Accordingly, there are local and global variables:

* local variables:
  
  * variables that are defined within function
  * these variables become unavailable after exit from function

* global variables:
  
  * variables that are defined outside the function
  * these variables are 'global' only within the module
  * for example, to be available in another module they must be imported

Example of local intf_config:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: def configure_intf(intf_name, ip, mask):
       ...:     intf_config = f'interface {intf_name}\nip address {ip} {mask}'
       ...:     return intf_config
       ...:

    In [2]: intf_config
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-2-5983e972fb1c> in <module>
    ----> 1 intf_config

    NameError: name 'intf_config' is not defined


Note that the intf_config variable is not available outside of the function. To get the result of a function you must call a function and assign result to a variable:

.. code:: python

    In [3]: result = configure_intf('F0/0', '10.1.1.1', '255.255.255.0')

    In [4]: result
    Out[4]: 'interface F0/0\nip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0'
