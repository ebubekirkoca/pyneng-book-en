File reading
-------------

Python has several file reading methods:

* ``read()`` - reads the contents of the file to the string
* ``readline()`` - reads file line by line
* ``readlines()`` - reads the file lines and creates a list from the lines

Letâ€™s see how to read contents of files using the example of r1.txt:

::

    !
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers
    !
    no ip domain lookup
    !
    ip ssh version 2
    !

``read()``
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``read()`` method reads the entire file to one string.

Example of the use of ``read()``:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [2]: f.read()
    Out[2]: '!\nservice timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year\nservice timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year\nservice password-encryption\nservice sequence-numbers\n!\nno ip domain lookup\n!\nip ssh version 2\n!\n'

    In [3]: f.read()
    Out[3]: ''

When reading a file once again an empty line is displayed in line 3. This is because the whole file is read when the ``read()`` method is called. And after the file has been read the cursor stays at the end of the file. The cursor position can be controlled by means of ``seek()`` method.

``readline()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File can be read line by line using ``readline()`` method:

.. code:: python

    In [4]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [5]: f.readline()
    Out[5]: '!\n'

    In [6]: f.readline()
    Out[6]: 'service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year\n'

But most often it is easier to walk through a **file** object in a loop without using  ``read...`` methods:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [8]: for line in f:
       ...:     print(line)
       ...:
    !

    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year

    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year

    service password-encryption

    service sequence-numbers

    !

    no ip domain lookup

    !

    ip ssh version 2

    !

``readlines()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another useful method is ``readlines()``. It reads file lines to the list:

.. code:: python

    In [9]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [10]: f.readlines()
    Out[10]:
    ['!\n',
     'service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year\n',
     'service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year\n',
     'service password-encryption\n',
     'service sequence-numbers\n',
     '!\n',
     'no ip domain lookup\n',
     '!\n',
     'ip ssh version 2\n',
     '!\n']

If you want to get lines of a file but without a line feed character at the end, you can use ``split()`` method and specify the symbol ``\n`` as a separator:

::

    In [11]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [12]: f.read().split('\n')
    Out[12]:
    ['!',
     'service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year',
     'service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year',
     'service password-encryption',
     'service sequence-numbers',
     '!',
     'no ip domain lookup',
     '!',
     'ip ssh version 2',
     '!',
     '']

Note that the last item in the list is an empty string.

If you use ``split()`` before ``rstrip()``, the list will be without empty string at the end:

.. code:: python

    In [13]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [14]: f.read().rstrip().split('\n')
    Out[14]:
    ['!',
     'service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year',
     'service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year',
     'service password-encryption',
     'service sequence-numbers',
     '!',
     'no ip domain lookup',
     '!',
     'ip ssh version 2',
     '!']

``seek()``
^^^^^^^^^^

Until now, the file had to be reopened to read it again. This is because after reading methods the cursor is at the end of the file. And second reading returns an empty string.

To read information from a file again you need to use the 
``seek`` method which moves the cursor to the desired position.

Example of file opening and content reading:

.. code:: python

    In [15]: f = open('r1.txt')

    In [16]: print(f.read())
    !
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers
    !
    no ip domain lookup
    !
    ip ssh version 2
    !

If you call ``read`` method again the empty string returns:

.. code:: python

    In [17]: print(f.read())

But with the ``seek`` method you can go to the beginning of the file (0 means the beginning of the file):

.. code:: python

    In [18]: f.seek(0)

Once the cursor has been set to the beginning of the file you can read the content again:

.. code:: python

    In [19]: print(f.read())
    !
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers
    !
    no ip domain lookup
    !
    ip ssh version 2
    !
