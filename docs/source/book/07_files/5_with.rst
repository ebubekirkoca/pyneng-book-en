Construction with
----------------

The construction **with** is a context manager.

Python has a more convenient way of working with files than the ones used so far - the construction ``with``:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: with open('r1.txt', 'r') as f:
      ....:     for line in f:
      ....:         print(line)
      ....:
    !

    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year

    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year

    service password-encryption

    service sequence-numbers

    !

    no ip domain lookup

    !

    ip ssh version 2

    !

In addition, the construction ``with`` guarantees file closure automatically.

Pay attention to how the lines of the file are read:

.. code:: python

    for line in f:
        print(line)

When the file needs to be run line by line, it is best to use this option.

In the previous output there were extra empty lines between the lines of the file because **print** adds another line feed character.

To get rid of this you can use ``rstrip`` method:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: with open('r1.txt', 'r') as f:
      ....:     for line in f:
      ....:         print(line.rstrip())
      ....:
    !
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers
    !
    no ip domain lookup
    !
    ip ssh version 2
    !

    In [3]: f.closed
    Out[3]: True

And of course, ``with`` construction can be used not only as a line-by-line reader, all methods that have been considered before also work:

.. code:: python

    In [4]: with open('r1.txt', 'r') as f:
      ....:     print(f.read())
      ....:
    !
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers
    !
    no ip domain lookup
    !
    ip ssh version 2
    !

Open two files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you have to work with two files simultaneously. For example, write some lines from one file to another.

In this case you can open two files in **with** block as follows:

.. code:: python

    In [5]: with open('r1.txt') as src, open('result.txt', 'w') as dest:
       ...:     for line in src:
       ...:         if line.startswith('service'):
       ...:             dest.write(line)
       ...:

    In [6]: cat result.txt
    service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone year
    service password-encryption
    service sequence-numbers

This is equivalent to:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: with open('r1.txt') as src:
       ...:     with open('result.txt', 'w') as dest:
       ...:         for line in src:
       ...:             if line.startswith('service'):
       ...:                 dest.write(line)
       ...:
