Python interpreter
====================

Before you start, check that when you call Python interpreter, the output is:

::

    $ python
    Python 3.7.3 (default, May 13 2019, 15:44:23)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Output shows that Python 3.7 is set. Invitation ``>>>``, this is a standard invitation from Python interpreter. Interpreter call is executed by python command and to exit you need to type ``quit()``, or press Ctrl+D.

.. note::
    Book will use ipython instead of standard Python interpreter
