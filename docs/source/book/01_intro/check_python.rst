Python interpreter
====================

Before you start, check that when you call the Python interpreter, the output is:

::

    $ python
    Python 3.7.3 (default, May 13 2019, 15:44:23)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

The output shows that Python 3.7 is set. The invitation ``>>>``, this is a standard invitation from the Python interpreter. The interpreter call is executed by the python command and to exit you need to type ``quit()``, or press Ctrl+D.

.. note::
    The book will use ipython instead of the standard Python interpreter
