1. Preparing for work
**********************

In order to start working with Python, you need to decide on a few things:

-  operating system
-  editor
-  Python version

This book uses Debian Linux (on other OS the output may differ slightly) and Python 3.7.

Virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete the tasks in the book, you can make a virtual machine. The following options are available:

- take the prepared virtual machine for the book
- use one of the cloud services
- prepare the virtual machine yourself


Course virtual machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete the tasks of the book, virtual machines have been prepared in which the following are installed:

- Python 3.7 in a virtual environment
- IPython
- almost all the modules that are required to complete the tasks

There are two options for course virtual machines (the links are for instructions for each option):

-  `Vagrant <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIb8prINPM7uhyFxIhSSIF1-jckN_OWkKaO8zHQus9g/edit?usp=sharing>`__. Login/password vagrant/vagrant
-  `VMware <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r7Si9xTphdWp79sKxDhVk2zjWGggfy5Z6h8cKCLP5Cs>`__. Login/password python/python


Cloud service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another option is to use one of the following services:
 
-  `repl.it <https://repl.it/>`__ – this service provides an online Python interpreter as well as a graphics editor.
   `Пример использования <https://repl.it/KSIp/3/>`__.
-  `PythonAnywhere <https://www.pythonanywhere.com/>`__ - a separate virtual machine. In the free version you can work only from the command line,
   that is, there is no graphical text editor
