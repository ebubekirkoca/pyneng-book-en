OS and editor
=============

You can choose any OS and any editor but it is better to use Python version 3.7
because book uses this version.
All examples in book were run on Debian, other operating systems may have a
slightly different output. You can use Linux, macOS or Windows to perform tasks from a book.

You can select any text editor or IDE that supports Python. Generally, working
with Python requires minimal editor settings and often the editor recognizes Python by default.

Mu editor
^^^^^^^^^

`Mu editor <https://codewith.mu/>`__ is a simple Python editor for beginner programmers.

Mu has clean and simple user interface. It has important features such as
checking code against PEP 8 and debugger.
Plus, Mu runs on different operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux).

IDE PyCharm 
^^^^^^^^^^^

`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ â€” is an integrated development
environment for Python. For beginners it may be difficult
option due to the large number of settings but it depends on personal
preferences. Pycharm supports a huge number of features, even in free version.

Pycharm is a great IDE but I think it's a little difficult for beginners.
I wouldn't recommend using it if you're not familiar with it and you're just
starting to learn Python. You can always switch to it after book but for now
it's better to try something else.


Geany

`Geany <https://www.geany.org/>`__ - is a text editor that supports different
programming languages, including Python. It is also a cross-platform editor
and supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

.. note::
