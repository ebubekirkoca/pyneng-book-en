OS and editor
=============

You can choose any OS and any editor but it is desirable to use Python version 3.7 because the book uses this version.

All of the examples in the book were run on Debian, but other operating systems may have a slightly different output. You can use Linux, macOS or Windows to perform tasks from a book. However, it is worth considering that, for example, Ansible can only be installed on Linux/macOS.

You can select any text editor or IDE that supports Python to work with Python. Generally, working with Python requires minimal editor settings and often the editor recognizes Python by default.

Mu editor
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is worth mentioning that `Mu editor <https://codewith.mu/>`__ it is an editor for beginners to learn Python (it supports only Python).

On the one hand, there’s nothing superfluous about it that can initially be very distracting and confusing. At the same time, it has important features such as checking code against PEP 8 and debugger. Plus, Mu runs on different operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux).

.. note::
    Video tutorials on Mu:

IDE PyCharm 
^^^^^^^^^^^

`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ — is an integrated development environment for Python. For beginners it may be difficult because of the plethora of settings but it depends on personal preferences. Pycharm supports a huge number of features, even in the free version.

Pycharm is a great IDE but I think it’s a little difficult for beginners. I wouldn’t recommend using it if you're not familiar with it and you’re just starting to learn Python. You can always switch to it after the book but for now it’s better to try something else.


Geany
^^^^^

`Geany <https://www.geany.org/>`__ - is a text editor that supports different programming languages, including Python. It is also a cross-platform editor and supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

.. note::
    The editor variants above are given for example, they can be replaced by any text editor that supports Python.
