Methods __str__, __repr__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special methods __str__ and __repr__ are responsible for string representation of the object. They are used in different places.

Consider example of IPAddress class that is responsible for representing IPv4 address:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: class IPAddress:
       ...:     def __init__(self, ip):
       ...:         self.ip = ip
       ...:

After creating class instances, they have a default string view that looks like this (the same output is displayed when print() is used):

.. code:: python

    In [2]: ip1 = IPAddress('10.1.1.1')

    In [3]: ip2 = IPAddress('10.2.2.2')

    In [4]: str(ip1)
    Out[4]: '<__main__.IPAddress object at 0xb4e4e76c>'

    In [5]: str(ip2)
    Out[5]: '<__main__.IPAddress object at 0xb1bd376c>'

Unfortunately, this presentation is not very informative. It would be better to display information about which address this instance represents. Special method __str__ is responsible for displaying information when using str() function. As an argument this method expects only instance and must return string.

.. code:: python

    In [6]: class IPAddress:
       ...:     def __init__(self, ip):
       ...:         self.ip = ip
       ...:
       ...:     def __str__(self):
       ...:         return f"IPAddress: {self.ip}"
       ...:

    In [7]: ip1 = IPAddress('10.1.1.1')

    In [8]: ip2 = IPAddress('10.2.2.2')

    In [9]: str(ip1)
    Out[9]: 'IPAddress: 10.1.1.1'

    In [10]: str(ip2)
    Out[10]: 'IPAddress: 10.2.2.2'

A second string view which is used in Python objects is displayed when using repr() function and when adding objects to containers such as lists:


.. code:: python

    In [11]: ip_addresses = [ip1, ip2]

    In [12]: ip_addresses
    Out[12]: [<__main__.IPAddress at 0xb4e40c8c>, <__main__.IPAddress at 0xb1bc46ac>]

    In [13]: repr(ip1)
    Out[13]: '<__main__.IPAddress object at 0xb4e40c8c>'

Method __repr__ is responsible for this display and it should also return a string, but it would return a string by copying which you can
get an instance of a class:


.. code:: python

    In [14]: class IPAddress:
        ...:     def __init__(self, ip):
        ...:         self.ip = ip
        ...:
        ...:     def __str__(self):
        ...:         return f"IPAddress: {self.ip}"
        ...:
        ...:     def __repr__(self):
        ...:         return f"IPAddress('{self.ip}')"
        ...:

    In [15]: ip1 = IPAddress('10.1.1.1')

    In [16]: ip2 = IPAddress('10.2.2.2')

    In [17]: ip_addresses = [ip1, ip2]

    In [18]: ip_addresses
    Out[18]: [IPAddress('10.1.1.1'), IPAddress('10.2.2.2')]

    In [19]: repr(ip1)
    Out[19]: "IPAddress('10.1.1.1')"
