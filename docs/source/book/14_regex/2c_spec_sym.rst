Special symbols
-------------------

*  ``.`` - any character except line feed character
*  ``^`` - beginning of line
*  ``$`` - end of line
*  ``[abc]`` - any symbol in brackets
*  ``[^abc]`` - any symbol except those in brackets
*  ``a|b`` - element a or b
*  ``(regex)`` - expression is treated as one element. In addition, the substring that matches the expression is memorized

``.``
~~~~~

Dot represents any symbol.

Most often, a dot is used with repetition symbols ``+`` and ``*`` to indicate that any character can be found between certain expressions.

For example, using expression ``Interface.+Port ID.+`` you can describe a line with interfaces in the output "sh cdp neighbors detail":

.. code:: python

    In [1]: cdp = '''
       ...: SW1#show cdp neighbors detail
       ...: -------------------------
       ...: Device ID: SW2
       ...: Entry address(es):
       ...:   IP address: 10.1.1.2
       ...: Platform: cisco WS-C2960-8TC-L,  Capabilities: Switch IGMP
       ...: Interface: GigabitEthernet1/0/16,  Port ID (outgoing port): GigabitEthernet0/1
       ...: Holdtime : 164 sec
       ...: '''

    In [2]: re.search('Interface.+Port ID.+', cdp).group()
    Out[2]: 'Interface: GigabitEthernet1/0/16,  Port ID (outgoing port): GigabitEthernet0/1'

The result was only one string as the dot represents any character except line feed character. In addition, repetition characters 
``+`` and ``*`` by default capture the longest string possible. This aspect is addressed in the subsection "Greedy symbols".

``^``
~~~~~
Character  ``^`` means the beginning of line. The expression ``^\d+`` corresponds to the substring:

.. code:: python

    In [3]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [4]: re.search('^\d+', line).group()
    Out[4]: '100'

Characters from beginning of line to pound sign (including pound):

.. code:: py

    In [5]: prompt = 'SW1#show cdp neighbors detail'

    In [6]: re.search('^.+#', prompt).group()
    Out[6]: 'SW1#'

``$``
~~~~~

Symbol ``$`` represents the end of a line.

The expression ``\S+$`` describes any characters except whitespace at the end of the line:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [8]: re.search('\S+$', line).group()
    Out[8]: 'FastEthernet0/1'

``[]``
~~~~~~

Symbols that are listed in square brackets mean that any of these symbols will be a match. Thus, different registers can be described:

.. code:: python

    In [9]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [10]: re.search('[Ff]ast', line).group()
    Out[10]: 'Fast'

    In [11]: re.search('[Ff]ast[Ee]thernet', line).group()
    Out[11]: 'FastEthernet'

Using square brackets, you can specify which characters may meet at a specific position. For example, the expression ``^.+[>#]`` describes characters from the beginning of a line to # or > sign (including them). This expression can be used to derive the name of the device:

.. code:: python

    In [12]: commands = ['SW1#show cdp neighbors detail',
        ...:             'SW1>sh ip int br',
        ...:             'r1-london-core# sh ip route']
        ...:

    In [13]: for line in commands:
        ...:     match = re.search('^.+[>#]', line)
        ...:     if match:
        ...:         print(match.group())
        ...:
    SW1#
    SW1>
    r1-london-core#

You can specify character ranges in square brackets. For example, it can be stated that we are interested in any number from 0 to 9:

.. code:: py

    In [14]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [15]: re.search('[0-9]+', line).group()
    Out[15]: '100'

Similarly, letters can be indicated:

.. code:: py

    In [16]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [17]: re.search('[a-z]+', line).group()
    Out[17]: 'aa'

    In [18]: re.search('[A-Z]+', line).group()
    Out[18]: 'F'

Several ranges may be indicated in square brackets:

.. code:: py

    In [19]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [20]: re.search('[a-f0-9]+\.[a-f0-9]+\.[a-f0-9]+', line).group()
    Out[20]: 'aa12.35fe.a5d3'

The expression ``[a-f0-9]+\.[a-f0-9]+\.[a-f0-9]+`` describes three groups of symbols separated by a dot. The characters in each group can be letters a-f or digits 0-9. This expression describes MAC address.

Another feature of the square brackets is that the special symbols within the square brackets lose their special meaning and are simply a symbol. For example, a dot inside the square brackets will denote a dot, not any symbol.

The expression ``[a-f0-9]+[./][a-f0-9]+`` describes three groups of symbols:

1. letters a-f or digits 0-9
2. dot or slash
3. letters a-f or digits 0-9

For *line* string the match will be a such substring:

.. code:: py

    In [21]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [22]: re.search('[a-f0-9]+[./][a-f0-9]+', line).group()
    Out[22]: 'aa12.35fe'

If first symbol in square brackets is ``^``, the match will be any symbol except those in brackets.

.. code:: python

    In [23]: line = 'FastEthernet0/0    15.0.15.1       YES manual up         up'

    In [24]: re.search('[^a-zA-Z]+', line).group()
    Out[24]: '0/0    15.0.15.1       '

In this case, the expression describes everything except letters.

``|``
~~~~~

Pipe symbol works like 'or':

.. code:: python

    In [25]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [26]: re.search('Fast|0/1', line).group()
    Out[26]: 'Fast'

Note how ``|`` works - Fast и 0/1 are treated as an whole expression. So in the end, the expression means that we’re looking for Fast or 0/1.

``()``
~~~~~~

Brackets are used to group expressions. As in mathematical expressions, brackets can be used to indicate which elements the operation is applied to.

For example, the expression ``[0-9]([a-f]|[0-9])[0-9]`` describes three characters: digit, then a letter or digit and digit:

.. code:: python

    In [27]: line = "100     aa12.35fe.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1"

    In [28]: re.search('[0-9]([a-f]|[0-9])[0-9]', line).group()
    Out[28]: '100'

Brackets allow to indicate which expression is a one entity. This is particularly useful when using repetition symbols:

.. code:: python

    In [29]: line = 'FastEthernet0/0    15.0.15.1       YES manual up         up'

    In [30]: re.search('([0-9]+\.)+[0-9]+', line).group()
    Out[30]: '15.0.15.1'

Brackets not only allow you to group expressions. The string that matches the bracketed expression is memorized. It can be obtained separately by special methods groups() and group(n). This is considered in the subsection "Grouping of expressions".
