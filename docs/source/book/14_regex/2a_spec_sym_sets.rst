Character sets
---------------

Python has special designations for character sets:

*  ``\d`` - any digit
*  ``\D`` - any non-numeric value
*  ``\s`` - whitespace character
*  ``\S`` - all except whitespace characters
*  ``\w`` - any letter, digit or underline character
*  ``\W`` - all except letter, digit or underline character

.. note::

    These are not all character sets that support Python. See 
    `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__ for details.

Character sets allow you to write shorter expressions without having to list all the necessary characters.

For example, get time from the log file string:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: log = '*Jul  7 06:15:18.695: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Ethernet0/3, changed state to down'

    In [2]: re.search('\d\d:\d\d:\d\d', log).group()
    Out[2]: '06:15:18'

The expression ``\d\d:\d\d:\d\d`` describes 3 pairs of numbers separated by colons.

Getting MAC address from log message:

.. code:: python

    In [3]: log2 = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [4]: re.search('\w\w\w\w\.\w\w\w\w\.\w\w\w\w', log2).group()
    Out[4]: 'f03a.b216.7ad7'

The expression ``\w\w\w\w\.\w\w\w\w\.\w\w\w\w`` describes 12 letters or digits that are divided into three groups of four characters and separated by dot. 

The symbol groups are very convenient, but for now it is necessary to manually specify the character repetition. The following subsection deals with repetition symbols which will simplify the description of expressions.
