Method submit and work with futures
-------------------------------

Method submit() differs from the map() method:

* submit() runs only one function in thread
* submit() can run different functions with different unrelated arguments, when map() must run with iterable objects as arguments
* submit() immediately returns the result without having to wait for function execution
* submit() returns special Future object that represents execution of function.

  * submit() returns Future in order that the call of submit() does not block the code. Once submit() has returned Future, the code can be executed further. And once all functions in threads are running, you can start requesting Future if the results are ready. Or take advantage of special function as_completed(), which requests the result itself and the code gets it when itâ€™s ready

* submit() returns results in readiness order, not in argument order
* submit() can pass key arguments when map() only position arguments

Method submit() uses `Future <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises>`__ object - an object that represents a delayed computation. This object can be resquested for status (completed or not), and results or exceptions can be obtained from the work. Future does not need to create manually, these objects are created by submit().


Example of running a function in threads using submit() (netmiko_threads_submit_basics.py file)

.. literalinclude:: /pyneng-examples-exercises/examples/20_concurrent_connections/netmiko_threads_submit_basics.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:


The rest of the code has not changed, so only the block that runs send_show() needs an attention:

.. code:: python

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        future_list = []
        for device in devices:
            future = executor.submit(send_show, device, 'sh clock')
            future_list.append(future)
        for f in as_completed(future_list):
            print(f.result())

Now block *with* has two cycles:

* ``future_list`` - a list of Future objects:

  * submit() function is used to create Future object
  * submit() expects the name of function to be executed and its arguments

* the next cycle runs through future_list using as_completed() function. This function returns a Future objects only when they have finished or been cancelled. Future is then returned as soon as work is completed, not in the order of adding to future_list


.. note::

    Creation of list with Future can be done with list comprehensions: 
    ``future_list = [executor.submit(send_show, device, 'sh clock') for device in devices]``

The result is:

::

Please note that the order is not preserved and depends on which function was previously completed.

Future
~~~~~~

An example of running send_show() function with submit() and displaying information about Future (note the status of the Future at different points in time):

.. code:: python

    In [1]: from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

    In [2]: from netmiko_threads_submit_futures import send_show

    In [3]: executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)

    In [4]: f1 = executor.submit(send_show, r1, 'sh clock')
       ...: f2 = executor.submit(send_show, r2, 'sh clock')
       ...: f3 = executor.submit(send_show, r3, 'sh clock')
       ...:
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 root INFO: ===> 17:53:19.656867 Connection: 192.168.100.1
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: ===> 17:53:19.657252 Connection: 192.168.100.2

    In [5]: print(f1, f2, f3, sep='\n')
    <Future at 0xb488e2ac state=running>
    <Future at 0xb488ef2c state=running>
    <Future at 0xb488e72c state=pending>

    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: ===> 17:53:25.869368 Connection: 192.168.100.3

    In [6]: print(f1, f2, f3, sep='\n')
    <Future at 0xb488e2ac state=running>
    <Future at 0xb488ef2c state=finished returned dict>
    <Future at 0xb488e72c state=running>

    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 root INFO: <=== 17:53:30.431207 Received: 192.168.100.1
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: <=== 17:53:31.636523 Received: 192.168.100.3

    In [7]: print(f1, f2, f3, sep='\n')
    <Future at 0xb488e2ac state=finished returned dict>
    <Future at 0xb488ef2c state=finished returned dict>
    <Future at 0xb488e72c state=finished returned dict>


In order to look at Future, several lines with information output are added to the script (netmiko_threads_submit_futures.py):

.. literalinclude:: /pyneng-examples-exercises/examples/20_concurrent_connections/netmiko_threads_submit_futures.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:


The result is:

::

    $ python netmiko_threads_submit_futures.py

     '192.168.100.3': '*07:14:37.413 UTC Fri Jul 26 2019'}


Since two threads are used by default, only two out of three Future shows running status. The third is in pending state and is waiting for the queue to arrive.

Processing of exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is an exception in function execution, it will be generated when the result is obtained

For example, in device.yaml file the password for device 192.168.100.2 was changed to the wrong one:

::

    $ python netmiko_threads_submit.py
    ===> 06:29:40.871851 Connection to device: 192.168.100.1
    ===> 06:29:40.872888 Connection to device: 192.168.100.2
    ===> 06:29:43.571296 Connection to device: 192.168.100.3
    <=== 06:29:48.921702 Received result from device: 192.168.100.3
    <=== 06:29:56.269284 Received result from device: 192.168.100.1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
      File "/home/vagrant/venv/py3_convert/lib/python3.6/site-packages/netmiko/base_connection.py", line 500, in establish_connection
        raise NetMikoAuthenticationException(msg)
    netmiko.ssh_exception.NetMikoAuthenticationException: Authentication failure: unable to connect cisco_ios 192.168.100.2:22
    Authentication failed.

Since an exception occurs when result is obtained, it is easy to add exception processing (netmiko_threads_submit_exception.py file):


.. literalinclude:: /pyneng-examples-exercises/examples/20_concurrent_connections/netmiko_threads_submit_exception.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:

The result is:

::

    $ python netmiko_threads_submit_exception.py
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 root INFO: ===> 07:21:21.190544 Connection: 192.168.100.1
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: ===> 07:21:21.191429 Connection: 192.168.100.2
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: ===> 07:21:23.672425 Connection: 192.168.100.3
    Authentication failure: unable to connect cisco_ios 192.168.100.2:22
    Authentication failed.
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 root INFO: <=== 07:21:29.095289 Received: 192.168.100.3
    ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 root INFO: <=== 07:21:31.607635 Received: 192.168.100.1
    {'192.168.100.1': '*07:21:31.436 UTC Fri Jul 26 2019',
     '192.168.100.3': '*07:21:28.930 UTC Fri Jul 26 2019'}


Of course, exception handling can be performed within send_show() function, but it is just an example of how you can work with exceptions when using a Future.
