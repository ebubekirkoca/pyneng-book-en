Module concurrent.futures
-------------------------

The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for working with processes and threads. For both threads and processes the same interface is used which makes it easy to switch between them.

If you compare this module with threading or multiprocessing, it has fewer features but with concurrent.futures it's easier to work and interface more understandable.

Concurrent.futures module allows to solve the problem of starting multiple threads/processes and getting data from them. For this purpose, the module uses two classes:

-  **ThreadPoolExecutor** - for threads handling
-  **ProcessPoolExecutor** - for process handling

Both classes use the same interface, so it is enough to deal with one and then just switch to the other if necessary.

Create an Executor object using ThreadPoolExecutor:

.. code:: python

    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)

After creating an Executor object, it has three methods: shutdown, map, and submit. Shutdown is responsible for the completion of threads/processes, when map and submit methods are responsible for starting functions in different threads/processes.

.. note::
    In fact, map and submit can run not only functions but any called object. However, only functions will be considered further.

The shutdown() method indicates that the Executor object must be finished. However, if to shutdown() method pass ``wait=True`` (default value),
it will not return the result until all functions running in threads have been completed.
If ``wait=False``, shutdown() method returns instantly but the script itself will not exit until all the functions have been completed.

Generally, shutdown() is not explicitly used because when creating an Executor object in a context manager, shutdown() is automatically called at the end of a block with ``wait=True``.

.. code:: python

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        ...

Since map and submit methods start a function in threads or processes, the code must at least have a function that performs one action and must be run in different threads with different arguments of the function.

For example, if you need to ping multiple IP addresses in different threads you need to create a function that pings one IP address and then run this function in different threads for different IP addresses using concurrent.futures.
