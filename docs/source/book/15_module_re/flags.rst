Flags
-----

When using functions or creating a compiled regular expression you can specify additional flags that affect the behavior of regular expression.

The **re** module supports such flags (in brackets - a short variant of flag designation):

* re.ASCII (re.A) 
* re.IGNORECASE (re.I) 
* re.MULTILINE (re.M) 
* re.DOTALL (re.S) 
* re.VERBOSE (re.X) 
* re.LOCALE (re.L) 
* re.DEBUG

In this subsection the re.DOTALL flag is considered. Information about other flags is available in `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.A>`__.

re.DOTALL
^^^^^^^^^

Regular expressions can also be used for multiline string.

For example, from *sh_cdp* string you need to get a device name, platform and IOS:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: sh_cdp = '''
       ...: Device ID: SW2
       ...: Entry address(es):
       ...:   IP address: 10.1.1.2
       ...: Platform: cisco WS-C2960-8TC-L,  Capabilities: Switch IGMP
       ...: Interface: GigabitEthernet1/0/16,  Port ID (outgoing port): GigabitEthernet0/1
       ...: Holdtime : 164 sec
       ...:
       ...: Version :
       ...: Cisco IOS Software, C2960 Software (C2960-LANBASEK9-M), Version 12.2(55)SE9, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
       ...: Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport
       ...: Copyright (c) 1986-2014 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
       ...: Compiled Mon 03-Mar-14 22:53 by prod_rel_team
       ...:
       ...: advertisement version: 2
       ...: VTP Management Domain: ''
       ...: Native VLAN: 1
       ...: Duplex: full
       ...: Management address(es):
       ...:   IP address: 10.1.1.2
       ...: '''

Of course, in this case it is possible to divide a string into parts and work with each string separately, but you can get the necessary data without splitting.

In this expression, the strings with the required data are described:

.. code:: python

    In [3]: regex = r'Device ID: (\S+).+Platform: \w+ (\S+),.+Cisco IOS Software.+ Version (\S+),'

In this case, there will be no match because by default a dot means any character other than a line feed character:

.. code:: python


    In [4]: print(re.search(regex, sh_cdp))
    None

You can change the default behavior by using the re.DOTALL flag:

.. code:: python

    In [5]: match = re.search(regex, sh_cdp, re.DOTALL)

    In [6]: match.groups()
    Out[6]: ('SW2', 'WS-C2960-8TC-L', '12.2(55)SE9')

Since line feed character is now included, combination ``.+`` captures everything between data.

Now try to use this regular expression to get information about all neighbors from sh_cdp_neighbors_sw1.txt file.

.. literalinclude:: /pyneng-examples-exercises/examples/15_module_re/sh_cdp_neighbors_sw1.txt
  :linenos:


Search for all regular expression matches:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: with open('sh_cdp_neighbors_sw1.txt') as f:
       ...:     sh_cdp = f.read()
       ...:

    In [8]: regex = r'Device ID: (\S+).+Platform: \w+ (\S+),.+Cisco IOS Software.+ Version (\S+),'

    In [9]: match = re.finditer(regex, sh_cdp, re.DOTALL)

    In [10]: for m in match:
        ...:     print(m.groups())
        ...:
    ('SW2', '2911', '15.2(2)T1')

At first glance, it seems that instead of three devices there was only one device in output. 
However, if you look at the results the tuple has Device ID from the first neighbor and platform and IOS from the last neighbor.

A short output to ease understanding of result:

::

    Device ID        Local Intrfce     Holdtme    Capability  Platform  Port ID
    SW2              Gi 1/0/16         171              R S   C2960     Gi 0/1
    R1               Gi 1/0/22         158              R     C3825     Gi 0/0
    R2               Gi 1/0/21         177              R     C2911     Gi 0/0

This is because there is a ``.+`` combination between the desired parts of the output.
Without the ``re.DOTALL`` flag, such an expression would capture everything before line feed character, but with the flag it captures the longest possible piece of text because ``+`` is greedy.
As a result, the regular expression describes a string from the first Device ID to the last place where ``Cisco IOS Software.+ Version`` meets.

This situation occurs very often when using ``re.DOTALL`` and in order to correct it remember to disable greedy behavior:

.. code:: python

    In [10]: regex = r'Device ID: (\S+).+?Platform: \w+ (\S+),.+?Cisco IOS Software.+? Version (\S+),'

    In [11]: match = re.finditer(regex, sh_cdp, re.DOTALL)

    In [12]: for m in match:
        ...:     print(m.groups())
        ...:
    ('SW2', 'WS-C2960-8TC-L', '12.2(55)SE9')
    ('R1', '3825', '12.4(24)T1')
    ('R2', '2911', '15.2(2)T1')
