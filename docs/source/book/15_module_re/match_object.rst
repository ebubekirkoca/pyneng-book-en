Match object
------------

In **re** module, several functions return Match object if a match is found:

* search 
* match 
* finditer - returns an iterator with Match objects

This subsection deals with methods of Match object.

Example of Match object:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [2]: match = re.search(r'Host (\S+) in vlan (\d+) .* port (\S+) and port (\S+)', log)

    In [3]: match
    Out[3]: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(47, 124), match='Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping betwee>'

The 3rd line output simply displays information about the object. Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on what is displayed in the match part as the displayed line is cut by a fixed number of characters.

group()
^^^^^^^

The group() method returns a substring that matches an expression or an expression in a group.

If method is called without arguments, the whole substring is displayed:

.. code:: python

    In [4]: match.group()
    Out[4]: 'Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

The same result returns group 0:

.. code:: python

    In [5]: match.group(0)
    Out[5]: 'Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

Other numbers show only the contents of relevant group:

.. code:: python

    In [6]: match.group(1)
    Out[6]: 'f03a.b216.7ad7'

    In [7]: match.group(2)
    Out[7]: '10'

    In [8]: match.group(3)
    Out[8]: 'Gi0/5'

    In [9]: match.group(4)
    Out[9]: 'Gi0/15'

If you call a group() method with a group number that is larger than the number of existing groups, there is an error:

.. code:: python

    In [10]: match.group(5)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    IndexError                      Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-18-9df93fa7b44b> in <module>()
    ----> 1 match.group(5)

    IndexError: no such group

If you call a method with multiple group numbers, the result is a tuple with strings that correspond to matches:

.. code:: python

    In [11]: match.group(1, 2, 3)
    Out[11]: ('f03a.b216.7ad7', '10', 'Gi0/5')

Group may not get anything, then it will be matched with an empty string:

.. code:: python

    In [12]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [13]: match = re.search(r'Host (\S+) in vlan (\D*)', log)

    In [14]: match.group(2)
    Out[14]: ''

If group describes a part of the template and there are more than one match, the method displays the last match:

.. code:: python

    In [15]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [16]: match = re.search(r'Host (\w{4}\.)+', log)

    In [17]: match.group(1)
    Out[17]: 'b216.'

This is because expression in brackets describes four letters or numbers, dot and then there is a  plus. Accordingly, the first and the second part of the MAC address matched to expression in parentheses. But only the last expression is remembered and returned.

If named groups are used in the expression, the group name can be passed to group() method and the corresponding substring can be obtained:

.. code:: python

    In [18]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [19]: match = re.search(r'Host (?P<mac>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'in vlan (?P<vlan>\d+) .* '
        ...:                   r'port (?P<int1>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'and port (?P<int2>\S+)',
        ...:                   log)
        ...:

    In [20]: match.group('mac')
    Out[20]: 'f03a.b216.7ad7'

    In [21]: match.group('int2')
    Out[21]: 'Gi0/15'

Groups are also available via number:

.. code:: python

    In [22]: match.group(3)
    Out[22]: 'Gi0/5'

    In [23]: match.group(4)
    Out[23]: 'Gi0/15'

groups()
^^^^^^^^

The group() method returns a tuple with strings in which the elements are those substrings that fall into the respective groups:

.. code:: python

    In [24]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [25]: match = re.search(r'Host (\S+) '
        ...:                   r'in vlan (\d+) .* '
        ...:                   r'port (\S+) '
        ...:                   r'and port (\S+)',
        ...:                   log)
        ...:

    In [26]: match.groups()
    Out[26]: ('f03a.b216.7ad7', '10', 'Gi0/5', 'Gi0/15')

The group method has an optional parameter  - default. It works when anything that comes into the group is optional.

For example, with this line the match will be in both the first group and the second:

.. code:: python

    In [26]: line = '100     aab1.a1a1.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1'

    In [27]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +(\w+)?', line)

    In [28]: match.groups()
    Out[28]: ('100', 'aab1')

If there is nothing in the line after the space, nothing will get into the group. But the match will be because it is stated in regular expression that the group is optional:

.. code:: python

    In [30]: line = '100     '

    In [31]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +(\w+)?', line)

    In [32]: match.groups()
    Out[32]: ('100', None)

Accordingly, for the second group the value is None.

If group() method is given a default value, it will be returned instead of None:

.. code:: python

    In [33]: line = '100     '

    In [34]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +(\w+)?', line)

    In [35]: match.groups(default=0)
    Out[35]: ('100', 0)

    In [36]: match.groups(default='No match')
    Out[36]: ('100', 'No match')

groupdict()
^^^^^^^^^^^

The groupdict() method returns a dictionary in which the keys are group names and the values are corresponding lines:

.. code:: python

    In [37]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [38]: match = re.search(r'Host (?P<mac>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'in vlan (?P<vlan>\d+) .* '
        ...:                   r'port (?P<int1>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'and port (?P<int2>\S+)',
        ...:                   log)
        ...:

    In [39]: match.groupdict()
    Out[39]: {'int1': 'Gi0/5', 'int2': 'Gi0/15', 'mac': 'f03a.b216.7ad7', 'vlan': '10'}

start(), end()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

start() and end() methods return indexes of the beginning and end of the match of regular expression.

If the methods are called without arguments, they return indexes for whole match:

.. code:: python

    In [40]: line = '  10     aab1.a1a1.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1  '

    In [41]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +([0-9a-f.]+) +(\S+)', line)

    In [42]: match.start()
    Out[42]: 2

    In [43]: match.end()
    Out[43]: 42

    In [45]: line[match.start():match.end()]
    Out[45]: '10     aab1.a1a1.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1'

You can transfer number or name of the group to methods. Then they return indexes for this group:

.. code:: python

    In [46]: match.start(2)
    Out[46]: 9

    In [47]: match.end(2)
    Out[47]: 23

    In [48]: line[match.start(2):match.end(2)]
    Out[48]: 'aab1.a1a1.a5d3'

Similarly for named groups:

.. code:: python

    In [49]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [50]: match = re.search(r'Host (?P<mac>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'in vlan (?P<vlan>\d+) .* '
        ...:                   r'port (?P<int1>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'and port (?P<int2>\S+)',
        ...:                   log)
        ...:

    In [51]: match.start('mac')
    Out[51]: 52

    In [52]: match.end('mac')
    Out[52]: 66

span()
^^^^^^

The span() method returns a tuple with an index of the beginning and end of substring. It works in a similar way to start() and end() methods, but returns a pair of numbers.

Without arguments span() returns indexes for whole match:

.. code:: python

    In [53]: line = '  10     aab1.a1a1.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1  '

    In [54]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +([0-9a-f.]+) +(\S+)', line)

    In [55]: match.span()
    Out[55]: (2, 42)

But you can also pass number of the group:

.. code:: python

    In [56]: line = '  10     aab1.a1a1.a5d3    FastEthernet0/1  '

    In [57]: match = re.search(r'(\d+) +([0-9a-f.]+) +(\S+)', line)

    In [58]: match.span(2)
    Out[58]: (9, 23)

Similarly for named groups:

.. code:: python

    In [59]: log = 'Jun  3 14:39:05.941: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host f03a.b216.7ad7 in vlan 10 is flapping between port Gi0/5 and port Gi0/15'

    In [60]: match = re.search(r'Host (?P<mac>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'in vlan (?P<vlan>\d+) .* '
        ...:                   r'port (?P<int1>\S+) '
        ...:                   r'and port (?P<int2>\S+)',
        ...:                   log)
        ...:

    In [64]: match.span('mac')
    Out[64]: (52, 66)

    In [65]: match.span('vlan')
    Out[65]: (75, 77)
