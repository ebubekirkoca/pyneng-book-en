Function re.sub
--------------

The re.sub function works similary to replace() method in strings. But in re.sub you can use regular expressions and therefore make substitutions using more complex conditions.
Replace commas, square brackets and *via* word with space in *ospf_route* string:

.. code:: python

    In [7]: ospf_route = 'O    10.0.24.0/24 [110/41] via 10.0.13.3, 3d18h, FastEthernet0/0'

    In [8]: re.sub(r'(via|[,\[\]])', ' ', ospf_route)
    Out[8]: 'O        10.0.24.0/24  110/41    10.0.13.3  3d18h  FastEthernet0/0'

With re.sub you can transform a string. For example, convert *mac_table* string to:

.. code:: python

    In [9]: mac_table = '''
       ...:  100    aabb.cc10.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/1
       ...:  200    aabb.cc20.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/2
       ...:  300    aabb.cc30.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/3
       ...:  100    aabb.cc40.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/4
       ...:  500    aabb.cc50.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/5
       ...:  200    aabb.cc60.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/6
       ...:  300    aabb.cc70.7000    DYNAMIC     Gi0/7
       ...: '''

    In [4]: print(re.sub(r' *(\d+) +'
       ...:              r'([a-f0-9]+)\.'
       ...:              r'([a-f0-9]+)\.'
       ...:              r'([a-f0-9]+) +\w+ +'
       ...:              r'(\S+)',
       ...:              r'\1 \2:\3:\4 \5',
       ...:              mac_table))
       ...:

    100 aabb:cc10:7000 Gi0/1
    200 aabb:cc20:7000 Gi0/2
    300 aabb:cc30:7000 Gi0/3
    100 aabb:cc40:7000 Gi0/4
    500 aabb:cc50:7000 Gi0/5
    200 aabb:cc60:7000 Gi0/6
    300 aabb:cc70:7000 Gi0/7

The regular expression is divided into groups:

-  ``(\d+)`` - the first group. VLAN number gets here
-  ``([a-f,0-9]+).([a-f,0-9]+).([a-f,0-9]+)`` - the following three groups (2, 3, 4) describe MAC address
-  ``(\S+)`` - the fifth group. Describes an interface.

In a second regular expression these groups are used. To refer to a group a backslash and a group number are used. To avoid backslash screening, the *raw* string is used.
As a result, the corresponding substrings will be substituted instead of group numbers. For example, format of MAC address record was also changed.
